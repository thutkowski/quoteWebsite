  "plain": "Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter (born September 4, 1981), better known professionally by her first name Beyonc\u00e9, is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, producer, actress and businesswoman.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, no pop star was as poised, as polished, or as generally fierce as Beyonc\u00e9. She scored early success with Destiny\u2019s Child, who started out as a sexier and sassier (if less adult) version of TLC, then steadily became more and more of a vehicle for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s operatic vocals and general diva-tude, which may have been the plan all along.\n\nWhether appearing in TV spots, co-starring in films like Dreamgirls, or killing it every night on stadium tours, Beyonc\u00e9 was omnipresent in the 2000s. Almost everybody, Beygency member or otherwise, loved shiny, hip-hop-fueled hits like \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d, and \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\u201d. Moving into the 2010s, Beyonc\u00e9 fights on, gaining more and more traction in pop culture with her work and music.\n\nShe has made a significant impact upon the music landscape in general with her recent albums 4 and BEYONC\u00c9, which explored complex themes like motherhood, feminism, marriage, sexuality, and doubt in a greater depth. With Lemonade, she went a step further\u2014the fierce, intimate exploration of marriage, infidelity, and forgiveness was her most personal album yet.\n\nIn 2018, after years of rumors, Yonc\u00e9 released the joint collaboration EVERYTHING IS LOVE with husband JAY-Z, paying tribute to their relationships and bringing a sonic edge to their healing process after the scandal and heartbreak expressed on Lemonade.\n\nIn 2022, she released RENAISSANCE, a musically daring trip through Dance, House, Disco and Ballroom past, present, and future.\n\nAs music continues to evolve in sound and subject, Beyonc\u00e9 continues to make her mark on the music industry and pop culture in general with her boundary-pushing, empowering, and evocative music. She is currently the most awarded artist alive (the second in history) and also has the record for the most nominations and wins in Grammy history."
